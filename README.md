# ðŸ“ˆ Sales Prediction

## Overview

The **Sales Prediction** project is designed to forecast product sales using historical sales data and machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factorsâ€”such as advertising spend, promotions, and customer segmentationâ€”this model helps businesses uncover key drivers of sales growth and optimize their marketing strategies.

## Objectives

- **Forecast Sales:** Build a predictive model that estimates product sales based on historical data.
- **Factor Analysis:** Examine the impact of variables like advertising expenditure, promotional activities, and customer segmentation on sales performance.
- **Robust Data Handling:** Manage missing values, detect and address outliers, and apply feature scaling to ensure optimal model performance.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Use appropriate metrics and visualizations to evaluate and fine-tune the model.

## Methodology & Approach

### 1. Data Collection & Exploration
- **Dataset:** The project uses the `car_purchasing.csv` dataset, which contains historical sales-related data.
- **Initial Exploration:** Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the distribution of features, detect missing values, and identify outliers.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Rows or columns with missing data are handled appropriately to maintain data integrity.
- **Outlier Detection:** Outliers are identified (using methods like IQR-based filtering) and removed to prevent skewing the model.
- **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features are standardized using techniques like StandardScaler to ensure uniformity across features.
- **Data Engineering:** Categorical variables (e.g., promotions, customer segmentation) are transformed using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### 3. Model Selection & Training
- **Algorithm Choice:** A Random Forest Regressor is utilized for its robustness and capacity to model complex, non-linear relationships.
- **Training:** The preprocessed and scaled data is split into training and testing sets. The model is then fitted on the training data.
  
### 4. Evaluation & Analysis
- **Performance Metrics:** The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **RÂ² Score**
  - **Custom Accuracy Metrics** (percentage of predictions within an acceptable error margin)
- **Visualizations:** Scatter plots, residual histograms, and bar charts are generated to visualize results and analyze error distributions.
  
### 5. Business Impact
- **Actionable Insights:** The modelâ€™s output assists in identifying critical marketing levers, enabling businesses to adjust their advertising spends and promotional strategies for improved sales growth.
  

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash

   cd Sales-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Ensure that the `car_purchasing.csv` file is placed in the `data/` folder.

4. **Run the Model:**
   - Launch the main script:
     ```bash
     python src/sales_prediction.py
     ```
   - Alternatively, open and run the Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder for an interactive experience.
